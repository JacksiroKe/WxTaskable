# Tasks Tracker
A desktop app to help you manage how you've spent your time on tasks during the day by tracking the time you've spent on tasks throughout the day

## Getting Started
Ensure you have downloaded a suitable [version](https://cmake.org/download/) of CMake. CMake **3.8** is the minimum supported version.

### Windows
You will need [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) to compile and manage the dependencies.
Once you've installed and configured `vcpkg`, install the following libraries:

 * sqlite3 (3.0 +)
 * spdlog (1.2 +)
 * wxwidgets (3.1 +)
 * rapidxml (1.13 +)

Ensure that when you have started Visual Studio that the _CMake Server_ does not give any warnings about missing packages.
You can now use Visual Studio to build the project. Currently only _Visual Studio 2017_ is supported to the version of CMake being used by Visual Studio.
